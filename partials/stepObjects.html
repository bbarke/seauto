<title>Step Objects</title>

<h2>Step Objects</h2>


<p>Step objects are simple POJOs that provide a logical grouping of related step methods.

<p>To add a new Step object, define the new class in the <b>step</b> package or subpackage. Steps should be packaged 
according to functionality/behaviour. New step classes probably need/want a <a href="#/storyContext">StoryContext</a> 
member variable that gets injected by the container. Other than the StoryContext, 
Step objects are usually stateless.  It's recommended that Step classes not extend 
from any class to maintain a simple step objects.  Additionally, Step classes should only contain public Step methods 
(see below) or private helper methods.  Any desire for protected or package viewable methods probably indicate the 
need for a <a href="#/sequence">Sequence object</a>.


<h3>Step methods</h3>
Step methods should have an appropriate javadoc comment that describes what the method does. 
Additionally, a stated pre-condition and post-condition indicating the assumed current browser 
page upon method entry and upon method exit is recommended.
